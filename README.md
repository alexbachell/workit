## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

My primary take away is that my HTML & CSS chops are actually more advanced than I previously gave myself credit for. I was able to look at the design file, make a mental map of how I would approach it, and execute what I envisioned (tweaking along the way, of course).

This was my first time using CSS Grid. I was aware of the layout system in the abstract, but had never had the opportunity to apply it in a project. It is nice to have another tool in the toolbox. Using CSS Grid to solve for the founder section was definitely a challenge at first, but turning on the grid inspection tool in Chrome really helped me visually understand what I was doing.

I was also able to further refine my problem solving skill-set. The curved background styling must have gone through at least 4 iterations before I found something that worked without relying (too much) on the good old "magic numbers".

Using GitHub version control also allowed me to stop and think about what I have done and document it more thoroughly.

### Continued development

This project took me more time to complete than I would have liked - probably 6 hours in total. In my previous experience as a WordPress/Divi developer I was used to only really using page builders, which I now know created some poor work habits. I will be able to get the development time down purely by practicing vanilla HTML & CSS more.

As this was my first time properly utilizing version control via GitHub, I'm sure my commit history and messages are a bit messy. Again, more practice will solve this.

Positioning is another area that I would like to further develop and refine.
